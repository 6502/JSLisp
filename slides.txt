JsLisp / A Lisp compiler targeting Javascript
What is JsLisp
  A Lisp
    A Lisp-2 (actually a Lisp-3) {Lisp-3}
      Scheme is a [Lisp-1]
        Only one namespace
        To call a function in a variable:|[(myvar x y z)]
      Common Lisp is a [Lisp-2]
        One namespace for functions/macro
        One namespace for variables
        In [(func x y z)] "func" is a|function, "x" is a variable
        To call a function in a variable:|[(funcall myvar x y z)]
      JsLisp is a [Lisp-3]
        Three namespaces
        A name can represent a variable, a function or a macro
        [(foo ...)] calls a macro (if defined)
        [(funcall #'foo ...)] calls a function
        Both the macro and the function can coexist
        They may even have different semantic {Different semantics example}
          [(< ...)] is short-circuiting
          [(funcall #'< ...)] is not
          [(< (f))] doesn't call [f] and returns [true]!
      No special operators
      No compiler-macros
      Just regular macros all the way down {Macros all the way down}
        Leaf nodes are [(js-code "...")] with literals
        Kernel written by hand in Javascript
        Kernel is still just macros and functions
        Everything else loads from [boot.lisp] {Bootstrap}
          [defmacro], [defun], [setf], [length]
          Quasiquoting, string interpolation
          [&optional], [&key], destructuring
          Static checks
        Quite a bit of inlined Javascript
    Macros are not necessarily hygienic {Macros}
      Anaphoric macros
      Wanted capture
      [gensym] used to avoid unwanted captures
      Global and lexical macros
      Symbol macros (both global and lexical)
    Reader macros
      Source of chars is a callable
      [(funcall src)] is current character
      [(funcall src 1)] advances to next
      [setf]-able place [(reader x)]
      [#'parse-value] is the main reader
    Modules (similar to CL packages) {Modules}
      Loading [(import gui)]
      Direct symbol access: [gui:window]
      Local nicknames: [(import gui as g)]
      Alias all exported: [(import * from gui)]
      Alias only some: [(import (x y) from gui)]
    Non-local control tansfer
      [tagbody] / [go]
      [block] / [return] / [return-from]
      [throw] / [catch]
      [unwind-protect]
      [(try <form> <exception-form>)]
  compiler
    No interpreter
      Reads one form at a time
      [toplevel-eval]uates it {Top level evaluation}
        Macroexpansion done explicitly and [toplevel-eval]|called on the result
        [progn] sub-forms are [toplevel-eval]uated in sequence
        [(if ...)] forms [toplevel-eval]uates condition|and only one of the two other subforms
        Anything else (e.g. [(let ...)]) uses compile+call
        Special handling of recursive functions
      Previously defined functions available in reader macros
      Reader macros available from next form
    JsLisp functions are Javascript functions {Interoperability}
      Javascript can call JsLisp functions and vice-versa
      [(js-code "...")] allows inline Javascript
      Name mangling
        [$$] at the beginning
        Dash ["-"] replaced with underscore ["_"]
        Invalid chars replaced with [$<numeric code>$]
        ["s"]ymbol, ["f"]unction,|["m"]acro or ["d"]ata
        [(str-value (gui:foo x '!))] compiles to|[f$$str_value(fgui$$foo(d$$x,s$$$33$))]
    Fast!
      Javascript JIT compilers are impressive
      Speed is closer to SBCL than to CLISP
      Generated javascript is horribly ugly...
      but not horribly inefficient
    Treeshaker/minifier
      Only what is reachable from [(main ...)]
      Current content of variables
      Cannot dump everything (e.g. DOM nodes)
      Minifier is specialized for JsLisp
      Output generally contains no readable symbols at all
    (but) Source-level debugging
      Debugger runs in another browser window
      Requires a local node.js webserver
      Breakpoints, step, data inspection, stack trace
      Debug information slows down quite a bit
  targeting Javascript
    Case sensitive
    No char type. Strings are immutable and unicode
    No [CONS] cells: lists are Javascript arrays. {Lists are Javascript arrays}
      No sharing of tails, only of whole lists
      Quasiquoting does not guarantee fresh lists
      [push] is a regular function, and appends at the END
      [(length x)] works for lists, strings
      [aref] works for lists, strings and objects
      [(setf (length L) x)] is valid for lists
    Dotted syntax reader macro {Dotted syntax}
      ["(foo).b.c"] compiles to ["f$$foo().b.c"]
      E.g. [(setf mydiv.style.overflow "hidden")]
      Field names are NOT mangled
      Invalid names compile to bracket notation
      Some field names are reserved! (e.g. "constructor")
    No numeric tower (all numbers are 64-bit floats)
    No [T], [NIL]. Truth-ness follows Javascript rules {What is false?}
      [false], [0], [NaN], [undefined], [null], [""]
      Anything else is "true"
      Including empty lists and empty objects
      [(= ...)] maps to Javascript [===]
      [(~= ...)] maps to Javascript [==] {Watch out conversions}
        [(~= (list) false)] is true
        But [(list)] is also true
        Ugly, but are Javascript rules
        Just don't use [(~= ...)]
Why not naked Javascript?
  Compile-time checks
    Mistyped variable names
    Mistyped function names
    Wrong number of parameters in call
    Wrong keyword arguments in call
  Local scope
  Modules
  Macros
  Domain specific languages
  Treeshaker
