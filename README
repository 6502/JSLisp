A tiny lisp compiler in javascript (not an interpreter, code compiles to javascript functions)

- lisp-2 common-lisp like (but not too much)
- indeed a lisp-3 (a macro and a function can have the same name)
- native types are javascript ones, with list = array
- no car/cdr (first is (aref x 0) and rest is (slice x 1))
- push works like javascript push (adding at the end!)
- case sensitive, name mangling (p2d? -> $$p2d$63$)
- true / false / null / undefined / NaN
- global / lexical / special (defined by defvar)
- setf / incf / decf with user-defined specializations
- defmacro, macrolet, symbol-macrolet, defmacro/f
- back quoting
- optional and keyword arguments, destructuring lambda lists
- tagbody/go, block/return/return-from, unwind-protect, throw/catch
- js-code escaping
- simple defstruct, defmethod (function specialization on generic condition)
- module support (similar to CL packages)
- treeshaker/minifier
... and a lot more ...
