@ Give it a try!

JsLisp REPL can run in most recent web browsers.

This means there is no program to download and to install.

You can start a new fresh JsLisp session in a separate
window by clicking the following button.

<<
<input type=button value="Start JsLisp" onclick="window.open('jslisp.html', '_blank', 'width=800, height=800, left=100, top=100')"/>
>>

If you want to install JsLisp on your own computer unfortunately you
need to use a local web server because for security reasons Ajax
requests are not supported on local filesystem browsing.
