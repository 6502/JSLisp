@ License

I am not a lawyer and I just hope this is enough to leave me out
of jail... if you think it's not, then please drop me a line.

The intention is that you can use JsLisp for whatever you want
(commercial or not) provided you just don't pretend you did something
that I did or that you blame me if you have any problem.

Note that of course I'm open about hearing any suggestion or
critics...  but I'm not currently willing to take to extra load of
thinking to someone else using JsLisp. I am using it for some pet
projects but if you do then please be sure you're also ready to pay
the price (i.e. porting everything or eventually maintaining your
clone of JsLisp).

In all honesty I don't refrain from making changes just because of my
already existing codebase. At the moment however I won't stop because
of your codebase either.
